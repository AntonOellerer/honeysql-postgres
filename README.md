# honeysql-postgres
[![Clojars Project](https://img.shields.io/clojars/v/nilenso/honeysql-postgres.svg)](https://clojars.org/nilenso/honeysql-postgres)

PostgreSQL extensions for widely used [honeysql](https://github.com/jkk/honeysql). This library extends the features of honeysql to support postgres specific SQL clauses and some basic SQL DDL in addition to the ones supported by the parent library. This library exists because it felt having a separate vendor specific namespace rather over having everything within honeysql.

Currently honeysql-postgres supports the following postgres specific clauses

- upsert
  - on conflict
  - on conflict on constraint
  - do update set
  - do nothing
- returning
- partition by
- over (window function)
- create view
- create table
- drop table

## Usage

### Leiningen
```clj
[nilenso/honeysql-postgres "0.2.0"]
```
### Maven
```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>nilenso</groupId>
  <artifactId>honeysql-postgres</artifactId>
  <version>0.2.0</version>
</dependency>
```
### repl
```clj
(require '[honeysql.core :as sql]
         '[honeysql.helpers :refer :all]
         '[honeysql-postgres.format :refer :all]
         '[honeysql-postgres.helpers :refer :all])
```

The query creation and usage is exactly the same as honeysql.

### upsert
`upsert` would be ideally written
```clj
(-> (insert-into [:distributors :d]
    (values [{:did 5 :dname "Gizmo Transglobal"}
             {:did 6 :dname "Associated Computing, Inc"}])
    (upsert (-> (on-conflict :did)
                (do-update-set :dname)))
    (returning :d.*)
    sql/format)
=> ["INSERT INTO distributors d (did, dname) VALUES (5, ?), (6, ?) ON CONFLICT (did) DO UPDATE SET dname = EXCLUDED.dname RETURNING d.*" "Gizmo Transglobal" "Associated Computing, Inc"]
```

Most of the times the above can also be written without the `upsert` helper function, you would need the `upsert` helper function only when you have sub queries or `where` clause within the upsert.
```clj
(-> (insert-into [:distributors :d])
    (values [{:did 5 :dname "Gizmo Transglobal"}
             {:did 6 :dname "Associated Computing, Inc"}])
    (on-conflict :did)
    (do-update-set :dname)
    (returning :d.*)
    sql/format)
=> ["INSERT INTO distributors d (did, dname) VALUES (5, ?), (6, ?) ON CONFLICT (did) DO UPDATE SET dname = EXCLUDED.dname RETURNING d.*" "Gizmo Transglobal" "Associated Computing, Inc"]

(-> (insert-into [:distributors :d])
    (values [{:did 5 :dname "Gizmo Transglobal"}
             {:did 6 :dname "Associated Computing, Inc"}])
    (upsert (-> (on-conflict :did)
                (do-update-set :dname)
                (where [:<> :d.zipcode "21201"])))
    (returning :d.*)
    sql/format)
=> ["INSERT INTO distributors d (did, dname) VALUES (5, ?), (6, ?) ON CONFLICT (did) DO UPDATE SET dname = EXCLUDED.dname WHERE d.zipcode <> ? RETURNING d.*" "Gizmo Transglobal" "Associated Computing, Inc" "21201"]
```

### over
You can make use of `over` and `partition-by` to write window functions
```clj
(-> (select :last_name :salary :department (sql/call :rank))
    (over (-> (partition-by :department)
              (order-by [:salary :desc])))
    (from :employees)
    sql/format)
=> ["SELECT last_name, salary, department, rank() OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC) FROM employees"]
```

### create view
`create-view` can be used to create views
```clj
(-> (create-view :metro)
    (select :*)
    (from :cities)
    (where [:= :metroflag "Y"])
    sql/format)
=> ["CREATE VIEW metro AS SELECT * FROM cities WHERE metroflag = ?" "Y"]
```

### create table
`create-table` and `with-columns` can be used to create tables along with the SQL functions, where `create-table` takes a table name as argument and `with-columns` takes a vector of vectors as argument, where the vectors describe the column properties as `[:column-name :datatype :constraints ... ]`.
```clj
(-> (create-table :films)
    (with-columns [[:code (sql/call :char 5) (sql/call :constraint :firstkey) (sql/call :primary-key)]
                   [:title (sql/call :varchar 40) (sql/call :not nil)]
                   [:did :integer (sql/call :not nil)]
                   [:date_prod :date]
                   [:kind (sql/call :varchar 10)]])
    sql/format)
=> ["CREATE TABLE films (code char(5) CONSTRAINT firstkey PRIMARY KEY, title varchar(40) NOT NULL, did integer NOT NULL, date_prod date, kind varchar(10))"]
```

### drop table
`drop-table` is used to drop tables
```clj
(sql/format (drop-table :cities :towns :vilages))
=> ["DROP TABLE cities, towns, vilages"]
```


### SQL functions
The following are the SQL functions added in `honeysql-postgres`
- not
```clj
(sql/format (sql/call :not nil))
=> ["NOT NULL"]
```
- primary-key
```clj
(sql/format (sql/call :primary-key))
=> ["PRIMARY KEY"]

(sql/format (sql/call :primary-key :arg1 :arg2 ... ))
=> ["PRIMARY KEY (arg1, arg2, ... )"]
```
- unique
```clj
(sql/format (sql/call :unique))
=> ["UNIQUE"]

(sql/format (sql/call :unique :arg1 :arg2 ... ))
=> ["UNIQUE (arg1, arg2, ... )"]
```
- foreign-key
```clj
(sql/format (sql/call :foreign-key))
=> ["FOREIGN KEY"]

(sql/format (sql/call :foreign-key :arg1 :arg2 ... ))
=> ["FOREIGN KEY (arg1, arg2, ... )"]
```
- references
```clj
(sql/format (sql/call :references :reftable :refcolumn))
=> ["REFERENCES reftable(refcolumn)"]
```
- constraint
```clj
(sql/format (sql/call :constraint :name))
=> ["CONSTRAINT name"]
```
- default
```clj
(sql/format (sql/call :default value))
=> ["DEFAULT value"]
```
- nextval
```clj
(sql/format (sql/call :nextval value))
=> ["nextval('value')"]
```
- check
```clj
(sql/format (sql/call :check [:= :a :b]))
=> ["CHECK(a = b)"]

(sql/format (sql/call :check [:= :a :b] [:= :c :d]))
["CHECK(a = b AND c = d)"]
```
